                <h3>Social Media and How it had Affected how People Express Their Views and Opinions</h3>
                <p>According to the New York Times writer Clair Cainn Miller in their article called "How Social Media Silences Debate" social media can be great for causes such as the Ice Bucket Challenge for MS but it is stifling the conversations and debate around policitcal issues. The reasoning be that people are afraid to voice their opinions on what is happening in the political climate espcially if it may differ from those around them. They also speak about how there are more groups of like minded people become friends online and contact in that way but it only makes the divide between groups larger.</p>
                <p>While people may not see it this way, some people think that social media make people more braisen and willing to share their opinions this is not true. The studies show thr former is true. It may seem that some of your more "extreme" friends and family do nothing but post about the political climate but online people are more likely to post something they are unhappy about then what they are happy about. Think of it this way, when you are really happy with a prodcut do you think you will go on and leave a review for the company? What about when you are upset about a product you got? Look at a restaurant you want to try out, are the reviews on google mostly good or bad? Social media is also ment to be a form of self expressionm it is often said people "hide" behind their computer screen. This also applies to how people express thier personal opinons, it is easier to speak your truth online then in person.</p>
                <p> What does this mean for the future of America? How can people adjust to close this large gap? Be more open to the opinions of your friends, family, and coworkers. Remember at the end of the day they are just opinons formed by the life that person as lived and not everyone is going to agree with your opinions. Try not to respond to every post you do not agree with and let people post how they are currently feeling.</p>

                <h3>Why Can't we Just Agree to Disagree?</h3>
                <p>While this topic is similar to the previous one, it goes deeper into the topic of why people may post or may not post.</p>
                <p>In personal experience, I have seen family memebrs verbally attack another family member, for posting her beilefs as well as my mother who was never mentioned in the post for "brainwashing" my siblings and myself. This negativity and family members not leaving any room for debate shuts down the conversation making both parties angry. </p>
                <p> The article from Chicago Tribune writer Jerry Davich hits on major points about how "left" and "right" both sides think they are right in their arguments. He points out that "...anyone who doesn't align with <i>their</i> truths is a traitor or an idiot or a trecherous threat to the nations future." meaning that people have a hard time listening to others and just accepting their points of view. Most people can't just accept that not everyone is going to feel the way they feel.</p>
