                <p>This can be a hard transition for children who have not had to deal with it their whole lives. It has often been said that if you are able to start the routine early in life it becomes second nature. When a child or teen has to change their routines in such a drastic way problems can arise with explaining the importance of ensuring monitoring blood sugar. This foundation works with doctors and certified practitioners who specialize in diabetes to help families learn how to handle dibetes together. They also provide financial support to those who may not beable to afford insulin for their children. </p>

                <h3>Why Did I Pick This Foundation?</h3>
                <p>My younger sister at age 13 got diagnosed with a life chagning disease called Pediactric Grave Disease, you may be thinking, thats not diabeates? You are correct, however she handeled it we well. Christyn had her thyroid removed that year with radiation and was put on medication for the rest of her life. We thought that may have been it for her illness, its annoying but she is strong so we thought she was fine. Her second year of college at age 20, she passed out in her show in her dorm. After going to the hospitial, she found out she was also diabetic. I believe had we known more about diabeates and what illness can cause this, at a younger age it would have been an easier life change for her. We believe she has probably had disbeates for awhile and we just didn't know, having all the informationa and assistance you can get can be life changing in situations like this.</p>
