                <h3>Social Media and How it had Affected how People Express Their Views and Opinions</h3>
                <p>According to the New York Times writer Clair Cainn Miller in their article called "How Social Media Silences Debate" social media can be great for causes such as the Ice Bucket Challenge for MS but it is stifling the conversations and debate around policitcal issues. The reasoning be that people are afraid to voice their opinions on what is happening in the political climate espcially if it may differ from those around them. They also speak about how there are more groups of like minded people become friends online and contact in that way but it only makes the divide between groups larger.</p>
